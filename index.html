			<h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>My name is Mateusz Obrochta or just Matt works. My parents immigrated here from Poland before I was born.
                Hence the unusual first name. I was born on September 15, 2000 which makes me 23 as of writing this.
                This will be my 3rd year here at Lewis and I am majoring in Computer Science. I chose this major
                because I gained an interest in computers from playing video games and wanted to try and make my own.

            <h2>What I hope to Learn in this Course</h2>
            <p>
                One think that I always wonder was how software projects were made in a group environment.
                I have yet to have a course have us code and make anything as a group even though that is 
                the industry standard. So essentially, I hope to learn how to effectively work with a group
                to develop software.
