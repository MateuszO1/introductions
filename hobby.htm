        <h1>My Hobby: PC Building</h1>
        <p>When I first got into gaming, I played on your typical Xbox/Playstation but then evetually
            got interested in getting a PC. My first &ldquo;PC&rdquo; was a laptop so it wasn't a powerhouse especially
            compared to what is out today. My first ever offical desktop computer was a pre-built from Best Buy
            that servered me well until I realized later down the line that I could easily build my own and not
            get ripped off for the cost of labor. When my brother and I both built our first PCs we got hooked on it.
            To this day, anytime a friend needs help building or fixing one we are always willing to help. We haven't built
            too many as PC parts are not cheap these days but we have attempted to build some PCs with custom water cooling
            that I have shown below.
